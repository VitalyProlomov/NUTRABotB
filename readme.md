NOT IMPLEMENTED YET
------------
File start_parameters.txt in root must contain one of 2 words: "test" or "prod"

If "test" is in the file, program runs in test mode: all the timings are shorter (seconds instead of miuntes (all divided by 60 as for 09.09.2025 version))

If "prod" is in file, everything runs as it should in prod version

TODO: write everything else
